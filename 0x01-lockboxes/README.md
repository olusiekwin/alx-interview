# Lockboxes

## Description
This project focuses on developing an efficient algorithm to determine if all lockboxes can be opened in a scenario where each box may contain keys to other boxes. It requires a solid understanding of lists and list manipulation, graph theory basics, algorithmic complexity, recursion, queue and stack data structures, and set operations.

## Concepts Needed
- **Lists and List Manipulation**: Understanding how to work with lists, iterate over them, and modify them dynamically.
- **Graph Theory Basics**: Knowledge of graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be helpful.
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Understanding the time and space complexity of the solution.
- **Recursion**: Some solutions may require a recursive approach.
- **Queue and Stack**: Familiarity with using queues and stacks, especially for BFS or DFS algorithms.
- **Set Operations**: Utilizing sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys.

## Resources
- [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](link-to-lists)
- [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](link-to-graph-theory)
- [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](link-to-big-o-notation)
- [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](link-to-recursion-python)
- [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](link-to-queue-stack)
- [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](link-to-sets)

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

## Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line**: The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README**: Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- **Documentation**: Code should be well-documented.
- **Style Guide**: Code should follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x).
- **Executable**: All files must be executable.
