# Minimum Operations

## Overview
This project, titled "Minimum Operations," is an algorithmic problem implemented in Python. It focuses on devising a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

### Project Details
- **Project Number**: 0x02
- **Topic**: Minimum Operations
- **Category**: Algorithm
- **Language**: Python
- **Weight**: 1
- **Start Date**: March 18, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Deadline**: March 22, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date**: March 19, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review**: Will be launched at the deadline

### Concepts and Resources
To effectively solve this problem, you will need to understand and apply several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts. Here are the concepts and resources that will be helpful:
- Dynamic Programming
- Prime Factorization
- Code Optimization
- Greedy Algorithms
- Basic Python Programming

### Additional Resources
- Mock Technical Interview

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
- **File Ending**: Ensure all files end with a new line
- **First Line**: All files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md**: Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- **Documentation**: Your code should be documented
- **Coding Style**: Adhere to the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable

## Tasks
### 0. Minimum Operations (mandatory)
In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. Your text editor can execute only two operations: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

- Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
- Returns an integer
- If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Example:
```python
n = 9
# H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
# Number of operations: 6
```
