# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that has various applications in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra. The goal of this project is to create a Python program that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## Resources
To successfully complete this project, it is recommended to review the following resources:
- [What is Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)
- [Pascal's Triangle - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sTZ_TxKDmg)
- [What are Python Algorithms](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/)

## Must Know
Before starting this project, ensure that you are familiar with the following Python concepts:
- **Lists and List Comprehensions**: Understand how to work with lists, iterate over them, and utilize list comprehensions for concise code.
- **Functions**: Know how to define and call functions, pass parameters, and return values.
- **Loops**: Use for and while loops for iteration, especially for nested loops required to generate Pascal's Triangle.
- **Conditional Statements**: Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Recursion (Optional)**: Understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing correct elements when constructing each row.
- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of list storage and copying, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.
- **Error and Exception Handling (Optional)**: Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors.
- **Efficiency and Optimization**: Consider time and space complexity, evaluate and apply optimizations for performance improvement.

By revisiting and understanding these Python concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the challenges of implementing Pascal's Triangle efficiently and effectively.
